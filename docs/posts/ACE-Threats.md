Hey everyone, just need to let you all know the anti-poor organization "ACE" (alliance for creativity) has started to track down individuals involved in piracy projects to threaten them in real life by showing up at their homes.

FMHY hasn't been directly threatened, but people close to us have, so I think now is a better time than ever to remind everyone that **FMHY is only 5MB of markdown.** Anyone in the world is allowed to take the files from github and host their own copy. In other words, even if something were to happen to me, it wouldn't be the end of FMHY. There can be as many copies of FMHY as there are people willing to host them.

I'd also like to ensure everyone that if FMHY.net, our subreddit, or our github are ever taken down, it means something out of our control has happened. **We would never under any circumstance pull the plug ourselves, even if threatened with arrest by ACE**. We're not scared of these organizations. The threat of arrest does not bother me. I accepted years ago it could end badly for me, but as long as FMHY survives, I don't mind.

Projects like FMHY help those in our world who are less fortunate, we know this, and we're not going to let capitalists bully us into their outdated worldviews. Piracy is just sharing. Sharing is moral. No organization will ever change that fact, regardless of how many sites they shutdown, or how many people they arrest. Governments can change laws, *but they can't shift morality*. 

Sharing has already won, its just a matter of protecting it now.

##### OPSEC tips for pirates running projects: 

- Isolate your real identity completely
- Avoid leaking your identity to any service
- Abandon + destroy identities when they're compromised
- Don't pay for anything in a way that can be traced back to you
- Avoid vercel + google analytics
